I'm not an expert on borrowing code. `./resource/data.csv` is borrowed from the syllapy project, and I have included the license from that project (under the resource directory) as a good faith effort to provide credit to the original author.

The rust code herein is licensed to you under either the Apache or MIT licenses (included in this repository) at your option.
